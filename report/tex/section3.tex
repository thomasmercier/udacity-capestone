\section{Choice of a learning architecture}

Learning a controller for our robot can be devided in three steps.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Learning of the sensor model to reduce the dimensionality of the problem
 \item Learning of the dynamic model to determine the short term response of the robot to control inputs
 \item Planning the long-term trajectory of the robot to acomplicomplish the required tasks
\end{enumerate}
Depending on the learning architecture, they can be treated together or separetly.
